# AUGMENTED_-REALITY_-MARKER-DETECTION
This project implements a basic Augmented Reality (AR) system using Python and OpenCV to detect markers and overlay virtual content in real-time. The goal is to simulate AR interactions by recognizing predefined visual markers (e.g., ArUco markers or custom patterns) and enhancing them with virtual elements such as 3D models, text, or images.
